Project 04


The following is the software needed/used:
	C++ 17
	Clion 2019.3.4
	"cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)"
	MinGW compiler was used

	Memory setting set to 5096 MB
		I changed the memory setting (help -> change memory setting) to 5096 MB from 2048 MB since I 
		was having memory issues for the 08 file. This will probably need to be done to run the file. 
		5096 MB is a bit overkill, but I wanted to make sure it worked.

With the exception of some includes (<tuple>, <deque>...), there are no packages in the project.	

When running the program:
	The program requires 1 command line argument which is a .txt file for the input. There are no
	other inputs needed from the user. 
	When the program is started, it will read the input and run the program. 
	When each task is finished it will print out the result of the task (think of it 
	like one at a time, rather than all at once). The program will close after printing the results.
